## PDTools.GT4ElfBuilderTool
Builds elf executables based on compressed/encrypted CORE.GT4 files for reverse-engineering (GT4)

Presumably CORE executables were made to allow 'updating' the game, or at least its executable, based on evidence from GT4O adhoc scripts.

Refer to [this page on the modding hub](https://nenkai.github.io/gt-modding-hub/ps2/executables/) for more info.
