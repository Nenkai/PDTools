# PDTools.SimulatorInterface

SimulatorInterface originally meant to be used by motion rig. This is the first ever open-source implementation.

This works for GT6/GTS/GT7.

This is **NOT** a telemetry source, quite some stuff is missing in general so you have to make do. Normally you would want to use the LiveTiming API instead, but PDI closes that down.
